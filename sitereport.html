        <p>Learning the basics of web development has been a journey filled with both challenges and rewarding moments. Initially, understanding HTML and CSS was daunting, but as I practiced and created more pages, my confidence grew. Debugging issues, especially with layouts, was frustrating at times, but each resolved problem taught me more about the intricacies of web design. Overall, this experience has equipped me with fundamental skills that I am excited to continue building upon.</p>
