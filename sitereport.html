            <h2>My Web Development Experience</h2>
            <p>It was challenging at times but definitely a great experience learning about the basics in web development. Honestly, I scored low in HTML and CSS when the term began, but over the term, I have come to realize the various processes involved in constructing a functional and stylistically appealing website.</p>
            
            <h2>Site Development</h2>
            <p>For the whole term, I centered my creativity on developing a themed website that is environment-friendly. For color selection, I wanted to have green colors to represent nature and the company’s commitment to environmental conservation. The site comprises five pages: Index, Projects, Contacts, Video Demo, and Site Report.</p>
            
            <h2>Design Part</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Color Scheme:</strong> On the issue of color selection, I chose different hues of green to give the impression of being environmentally conscious. Green connotes new growth and harmonization which are in tune with what my website is all about.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Fonts:</strong> For fonts, I decided to opt for ‘Segoe UI’ which is simple and easy to read, while for headings, I opted for ‘Georgia’ to make the design seem more classy. The home-page is designed to capture visitor attention first through a profile of myself. The use of grid layout is evident on the project page to provide a neat arrangement of the project thumbnails.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Learning:</strong> It was essential learning the structure of HTML and the styling aspect of CSS. There were several issues that I faced while designing for the web but I sorted them out using media queries.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p>Bugs had been puzzling, and the process of eradicating them was always a stressful session. But tricks such as the Chrome Developer Tools proved to be extremely useful in debugging the applications.</p>
            
            <h2>Validation Reports</h2>
            <p>If not for this validation, I would not be able to determine if my HTML and CSS codes are standard and up to par with the correct syntax.</p>
